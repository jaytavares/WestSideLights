Control your Christmas lights via Twitter!
------------------------------------------

Want the best remote control for your Christmas lights? TwitteringLights will let you and the rest of the world control your GE ColorEffects Christmas lights using Twitter!

This project is inspired by and compatible with @Cheerlights (http://cheerlights.com). With TwitteringLights, your Christmas lights will respond to color requests tweeted to @cheerlights; however, your lights will also listen to other hashtags which, unlike cheerlights, can trigger awesome chases. For instance, tweet 'merry christmas' to your lights and they'll chase red and green lights!

I'll provide a link with more information on the hardware necessary for the interface in the near future. Stay tuned!
